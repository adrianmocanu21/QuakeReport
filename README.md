This app displays a list of recent earthquakes in the world
from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) organization.

It was build to help gain knowledge regarding the networking topic of the Android development process.
Through this application I have learned what AssyncTasks are and how we can use Loaders for better performances ( Ex: saving memory by closing an opened AsyncTask when the state off the Activity that uses it is changed).
